I updated the design doc with a better visualization of the program components,
as well as splitting off login and logout in the site map. Login is also
responsible for returning the login error that was encountered. In addition, login
will now be able to go to a list of blogs on top of other sites, and search will
be able to return a list of blogs as well as blog posts. I also changed around the
scope of some roles as well as elaborate on the scope of work that we will be doing.
I also made the readme with important headers and roles for now.

I added the designwiki0 and designwiki1 files (previous permutations)

shadmanR -- 2021-10-29 09:05

I started working on an AuthService class that could be used for getting the registering, loging in,
getting the current user, managing sessions, etc.

I updated README with the install instructions and made a superior name for the blog. Also
made a requirement.txt and ensured that app.py was functional (college apps are a pain).

andyL -- 2021-11-01 09:01

I fixed the dependencies in requirements.txt (as the dependencies were excessive). I also
added a few more funcs dedicated for fetching blog post info.

shadmanR -- 2021-11-02 19:51

-worked more on refactoring the code to use packages for database and authentication.
-wrote basic database functions related to initialization and auth
-wrote login and current user functions

andyL -- 2021-11-02 22:39

I worked on ensuring that the register website worked (with form for display name, username,
password), even if the current setup is super janky right now. Also removed references in
register page that referred to login page. Register will redirect to a url that manages signup,
then redirect to login page. Removed login button from home page (this is to be line with Mykolyk's
requests). Combined db.py and old backend.py scripts together. Made a loadHomePage func that loads all
blogs (like a feed).

andyL -- 2021-11-02 09:15

I worked on fixing some URLs up so that they would follow the design doc. Also fixed the issue where the
database values did not save between different database instances. Also merged app.py into init.py and
added another function to update a blog post.

raymondY -- 2021-11-03 17:52

-fixed some bugs
-new template (createPosts)
-basic css (centering only rn)
-links on home page (for testing, not sure if the current layout is what we want.)

shadmanR -- 2021-11-02 09:15

Improved auth by using sessionIDs and hashing and salting passwords
Refactored the code to use a Response class. Added error handling for the database and auth functions.

andyL -- 2021-11-04 00:32

I worked on ensuring that I could make a blog post (which partially works). Also fixed some sqlite3 related issues.

andyL -- 2021-11-04 09:23

I worked on fixing the create blog post page (which is now done). Also started to work on the home page blog post feed (now renders out title and author name).
